Find the Sum of N Natural Numbers in Java
Given an integer num input as the upper limit, the objective is to sum up all the numbers that lay in the interval starting from 0 to the integer input “num”. Here are some of the methods to sum up all the numbers in a given interval

Method 1: Using for Loop
Method 2: Using Formula
Method 3: Using Recursion
We’ll discuss the above mentioned methods in detail in the sections below.

Method 1: Using for Loop
In this method we’ll use for loop to iterate through the numbers in a range of [0,num].

Working
For an integer input “num” we do the following

initialize the required variables within the class.
Run a for loop from 0 to num+1 meanwhile appending all the numbers to sum variable.
Print the sum variable.
Let’s implement the logic in Java Language.

Method 2: Using the Formula
In this method we’ll use a formula to find the sum of N integers in a series from sequence and series. The formula is mentioned below.

Formula to Find the Sum of N Integers
Sum = num * ( num + 1 ) / 2
Working
For an integer input we do the following operations

Initialize the following variables.
Implement the formula as sum = num * ( num + 1 ) / 2.
Print the sum variable.
Let’s implement the above logic in Java language.

Method 3: Using Recursion
In this method we’ll use the concept of recursion to find the sum of all the number that lay from 0 to num. To know more about recursion, check out Recursion in Java

Working
For a given integer input as “num” we perform the following steps

Initialize the required variables.
Define a recursive function with base case as num == 0.
Set recursive step call as num + recursum(num-1).
Call the recursive function and print the value returned by the function.
Let’s implement the above logic in Java Language.
